C02_EMMISSIONS_CHN,"Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emmissions - China. Million Tonnes of carbon dioxide. Carbon emissions reflect only those through consumption of oil, gas and coal, and are based on standard global average conversion factors. This does not allow for any carbon that is sequestered, for other sources of carbon emissions, or for emissions of other greenhouse gases. The data is therefore not comparable to official national emissions data. The table is compiled on the basis of carbon content: oil - 73,300 kg CO2 per TJ (3.07 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent); natural gas - 56,100 kg CO2 per TJ (2.35 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent); coal - 94,600 kg CO2 per TJ (3.96 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent)."

As far as possible, the data represents standard cubic metres (measured at 15oC and 1013 mbar); as they are derived directly from tonnes of oil equivalent using an average conversion factor, they do not necessarily equate with gas volumes expressed in specific national terms. The difference between these world consumption figures and the world production statistics is due to variations in stocks at storage facilities and liquefaction plants, together with unavoidable disparities in the definition, measurement or conversion of gas supply and demand data."
