C02_EMMISSIONS_RUS,"Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emmissions - Russian Federation. Million Tonnes of carbon dioxide. Carbon emissions reflect only those through consumption of oil, gas and coal, and are based on standard global average conversion factors. This does not allow for any carbon that is sequestered, for other sources of carbon emissions, or for emissions of other greenhouse gases. The data is therefore not comparable to official national emissions data. The table is compiled on the basis of carbon content: oil - 73,300 kg CO2 per TJ (3.07 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent); natural gas - 56,100 kg CO2 per TJ (2.35 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent); coal - 94,600 kg CO2 per TJ (3.96 tonnes per tonne of oil equivalent)."
COAL_CONSUM_O_RUS,"Coal Consumption - Oil Equivalent - Russian Federation. Million Tonnes oil equivalent. Commercial solid fuels only, i.e. bituminous coal and anthracite (hard coal), and lignite and brown (sub-bituminous) coal. Growth rates are adjusted for leap years."

ELEC_GEN_RUS,Electricity Generation - Russian Federation. Terawatt Hours. Based on gross output.
GAS_CONSUM_D_RUS,"Natural Gas Consumption - Daily Average - Russian Federation. Billion cubic feet per day. The difference between these world consumption figures and the world production statistics is due to variations in stocks at storage facilities and liquefaction plants, together with unavoidable disparities in the definition, measurement or conversion of gas supply and demand data. As the data above are derived from tonnes oil equivalent using average conversion factors, they do not necessarily equate with gas volumes expressed in specific national terms. Annual changes and shares of total are calculated in million tonnes of oil equilevent figures. Growth rates are adjusted for leap years."
